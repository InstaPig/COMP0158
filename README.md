## Data Processing
The manipulation and processing of data are complted with both type of scripts.

## Exploratory Analysis 
The plots and choropleth maps are mostly completed with the python notebook.

## Modelling
- The majority of models were built with R.
- The Deep Neural Network were implemented using python, Keras.
- The spatial regression model has also been tested in the python notebook.
